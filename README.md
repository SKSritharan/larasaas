## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up Larasaas on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL or another supported database
- Stripe account (for subscription billing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SKSritharan/larasaas.git
   cd larasaas
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

   Install JavaScript dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and Stripe API keys:

   ```dotenv
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

   STRIPE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
   STRIPE_SECRET=your-stripe-secret-key
   ```

4. **Generate Application Key**

   Generate a unique application key:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Run Migrations**

   Set up the database schema & get default user, roles, and permissions by running following command:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

    > The default admin credentials for accessing the admin panel are:
    > Email: ```admin@admin.com```
    > Password: ```password```
    > Make sure to change these credentials after your initial login for security purposes.

6. **Start the Development Server**

   Launch the application using Laravel's built-in server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view the application.

## Stripe Plans Synchronization

To synchronize your subscription plans with Stripe, follow these steps:

1. **Set Stripe API Keys**

   Ensure your Stripe API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file:

   ```dotenv
   STRIPE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
   STRIPE_SECRET=your-stripe-secret-key
   ```

2. **Run the Sync Command**

   Synchronize your plans with Stripe using the following Artisan command:

   ```bash
   php artisan plans:sync
   ```

   This command will fetch your Stripe products and prices and store them in the local database.

Certainly! Here's a refined and more detailed version of the Stripe Webhooks setup instructions:

## Stripe Webhooks Setup

To handle real-time events from Stripe, you need to set up Stripe webhooks. Follow these steps to configure and test webhooks in Larasaas:

### 1. **Create a Stripe Webhook**

Run the following command to create a Stripe webhook:

```bash
php artisan stripe:webhook
```

This command will create a webhook endpoint in your Stripe Dashboard and print the **Webhook Signing Secret**. Copy this secret.

### 2. **Update `.env` with Webhook Secret**

Add the **Webhook Signing Secret** to your `.env` file:

```dotenv
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-signing-secret
```

### 3. **Listen to Stripe Events**

Use the Stripe CLI to listen to events and forward them to your local development environment. Run the following command:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://larasaas.test/stripe/webhook
```
Replace `http://larasaas.test/stripe/webhook` with your actual webhook URL.

### 4. **Trigger Test Events**

To test your webhook, trigger a test event using the Stripe CLI. For example, to simulate a successful payment, run:

```bash
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
```

- This will send a test event to your webhook URL.
- You can view the event details in your Stripe Dashboard under **Developers > Webhooks > Events**.

### 5. **Verify Webhook Handling**

- Check your Laravel logs (`storage/logs/laravel.log`) to ensure the webhook events are being handled correctly.
